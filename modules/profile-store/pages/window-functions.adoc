= Querying Time-Series data in Couchbase with Window Functions
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

== Overview

This tutorial will show a time-series report about user event activity using both window functions and common table expressions (CTEs). The ultimate goal is to build a report that can help show any trends or patterns in user activity. This tutorial will not focus on visualization, but the end result could look something like this:

This tutorial is part of the main User Profile tutorial (both xref:dotnet.adoc[.NET] and xref:java.adoc[Java]). You should be able to follow along if you haven't gone through those tutorials yet, but reading those tutorials first will give you more context.

This tutorial contains 5 parts:

* <<Setup and Prerequisites>> What you'll need to follow along.
* <<Introduction to Window Functions>> What are window functions for?
* <<Introduction to Common Table Expressions>> What are CTEs for?
* <<Querying User Events>> Executing time series queries against user event data
* <<Summary>> A quick summary of this tutorial and next steps.

== Setup and Prerequisites

This tutorial uses window functions, which were first introduced to Couchbase Server in version 6.5.

Additionally, the data being queried in this tutorial comes from the main User Profile tutorial (xref:dotnet.adoc[.NET] and xref:java.adoc[Java]). If you are following along with those tutorials, you should have a data set that contains user events. For reference, the user profile store should contain many user event documents which look like this:

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
{
  "createdDate": "2019-08-11T16:54:03.7227615-04:00",
  "eventType": 1,
  "userId": "user::70231780-3eef-40d6-b689-0a0d6455824e",
  "type": "userEvent"
}

OR

{
  "createdDate": 1565691905000,
  "eventType": 1,
  "userId": "user::70231780-3eef-40d6-b689-0a0d6455824e",
  "type": "userEvent"
}
----

The rest of this tutorial assumes you have a number of these type of documents in a bucket called *user_profile*.

If you don't, you can load this sample data set: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/tutorials-contrib/blob/master/modules/profile-store/examples/user-profile-sample.json?raw=true[user-profile-sample.json file (large JSON file)].

[source,PowerShell,indent=0]
----
cbimport json -c localhost -u Administrator -p
password -b user_profile -d file://user-profile-sample.json -f list -g %id%
----

After this is complete, you should see a message like this:

[source,PowerShell,indent=0]
----
Json `file://user-profile-sample.json` imported to `http://localhost:8091` successfully
Documents imported: 25000 Documents failed: 0
----

For more details on loading this sample data set, see the xref:building-indexes.adoc[indexing user profiles tutorial].

== Introduction to Window Functions

Window functions are useful for reporting aggregations or cumulative data. The `OVER` clause defines a *window* over which these values will be calculated.

There are a number of window functions available in Couchbase Server 6.5+. This tutorial will only be showing basic usage of `OVER`, but please refer to the full xref:server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/windowfun.adoc[window functions documentation] for details about functions like `CUME_DIST`, `DENSE_RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`, and much more.

Within xref:server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/window.adoc[the `OVER` clause], `PARTITION` specifies the field that describes the window. For example, to get a sum of the number of activities by a time segment:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT
    e.segment,
    SUM(e.numEvents) OVER(PARTITION BY e.segment) AS numEvents
FROM /* ... etc ... */
----

== Introduction to Common Table Expressions

A common table expression is a way to define a temporary set of results which can be referenced later in the query. Most often this is used to simplify a query when a result set is used several times.

Use the `WITH` clause to create a common table expression. Please refer to the complete xref:server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/with.adoc[documentation on the `WITH` clause] for more information.

For this tutorial, notice that each user event has a `createdDate` field which contains a timestamp. However, for reporting purposes, it would be more useful to group these events into some segment (like a 15 minute interval).

One approach might be to calculate the segment (based on the timestamp) and put those results into a CTE for further querying. For example:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
WITH segmentedUserEvents AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_ADD_STR(DATE_TRUNC_STR(u.createdDate,"hour"), ROUND(DATE_PART_STR(u.createdDate,"minute")/15,0)*15,"minute") as segment,
        u.eventType,
        COUNT(*) AS numEvents
    FROM user_profile u
    WHERE u.type = 'userEvent'
    GROUP BY DATE_ADD_STR(DATE_TRUNC_STR(u.createdDate,"hour"), ROUND(DATE_PART_STR(u.createdDate,"minute")/15,0)*15,"minute"), u.eventType
)
SELECT /* ... etc ... */
----

After the initial `WITH`, the remainder of the query can refer to `segmentedUserEvents` instead of repeating the entire contents. This allows a query writer to simplify the entire query, as well as isolate certain components.

Note that the combination of `DATE_ADD_STR`, `DATE_TRUNC_STR`, and `ROUND` returns a "segment" date, rounded to 15 minute segments. Examples are: "2019-08-11T15:30:00-04:00", "2019-08-11T15:45:00-04:00", etc.

NOTE: If you are storing dates as milliseconds instead of a string, you will need to use a different set of `DATE` functions. For example: `DATE_ADD_MILLIS(DATE_TRUNC_MILLIS(u.createdDate,"hour"), ROUND(DATE_PART_MILLIS(u.createdDate,"minute")/15,0)*15,"minute")`

== Querying User Events

Putting together this CTE with the `OVER(PARTITION ...)` from earlier, build a query that will find the number of certain types of events that occurred within each segment of time.

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
WITH segmentedUserEvents AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_ADD_STR(DATE_TRUNC_STR(u.createdDate,"hour"), ROUND(DATE_PART_STR(u.createdDate,"minute")/15,0)*15,"minute") as segment,
        u.eventType,
        COUNT(*) AS numEvents
    FROM user_profile u
    WHERE u.type = 'userEvent'
    GROUP BY DATE_ADD_STR(DATE_TRUNC_STR(u.createdDate,"hour"), ROUND(DATE_PART_STR(u.createdDate,"minute")/15,0)*15,"minute"), u.eventType
)
SELECT
    e.segment,
    SUM(e.numEvents) OVER(PARTITION BY e.segment) AS numEvents
FROM segmentedUserEvents e
AND e.segment BETWEEN '2019-08-11' AND '2019-08-12'
WHERE e.eventType = 1
ORDER BY e.segment;
----

This query uses a CTE to segment each user event. It then uses `OVER` to sum up the number of events in each segment. The raw data result should look similar to:

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
[
  { "numEvents": 5, "segment": "2019-08-11T15:30:00-04:00" },
  { "numEvents": 5, "segment": "2019-08-11T15:45:00-04:00" },
  { "numEvents": 8, "segment": "2019-08-11T16:00:00-04:00" },
  
  /* ... etc ... */

]
----

This query and/or the resulting data can be fed directly into a data visualization tool. This screenshot shows a simple webpage using a JavaScript visualization tool.

Upon clicking "Load", the tool makes an HTTP request to an endpoint that executes the above query.

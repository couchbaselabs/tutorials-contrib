:description: This tutorial teaches you how to use Couchbase Server for a user profile store.

To use Couchbase as a session store, you must first install Couchbase (somewhere). Then, you must set up the Couchbase cluster. Finally, you'll need to create a bucket to store the session data.

== Getting Started

There are a number of options for getting started with Couchbase Server:

* Directly on your computer: follow the xref:server:install:install-intro.adoc[Install] guide.
* Docker: follow the xref:server:getting-started:do-a-quick-install.adoc[Quick Install] guide.
* Kubernetes or OpenShift: use the xref:operator::overview.adoc[Couchbase Autonomous Operator] to create and manage a Couchbase cluster.
* Cloud: Couchbase has partnered with https://www.couchbase.com/partners/amazon[Amazon AWS], https://www.couchbase.com/partners/microsoft[Microsoft Azure], and https://www.couchbase.com/partners/google[Google Cloud Platform].

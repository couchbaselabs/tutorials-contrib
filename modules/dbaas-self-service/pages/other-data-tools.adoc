[#doc-viewer]
=== Document Viewer

Another simple and fast way to find and look at documents is by selecting Tools, then Documents.

Here are a few things you can do with the document viewer: 

* Change your buckets, scopes, and collections to see documents segmented in those ways.
Set bucket to Travel Sample, scope to Inventory and collection to Hotel
* Click on a document name in the ID column to open and edit that document. 
From within the flyout, at the top, it shows you the document hierarchy.
* Change the default doc limit from 5, to see more documents
* Change the offset to skip the first X documents. 
Change it to 25 and see your list change.
* Search documents by document ID. 
In the Id box, paste “hotel_21725” and press retrieve. 
This will pull up a hotel in Paris near the Louvre Metro.
* In the N1QL Where box, paste the following: `city='Half Moon Bay'` -- this will bring up the hotel located in this California town.


[#indexes]
=== Sample Indexes

Now let's look at the cluster indexes. 
Choose the Tools tab then Indexes.

In Couchbase, _primary_ and _global secondary indexes_ -- also known as just _indexes_  -- are predefined subsets of bucket-data created by the xref:cloud:clusters:index-service/index-service.adoc[Index Service]. 

The sample buckets automatically created indexes upon import. 
For more information about viewing and interacting with indexes, refer to xref:cloud:clusters:index-service/index-service.adoc[Index Service].

If you select an index, it will open a flyout with more details about that index. 
Here you can see the number of items covered by that index and how it is performing.

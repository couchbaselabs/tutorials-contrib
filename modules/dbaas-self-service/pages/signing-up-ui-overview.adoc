Couchbase Capella is a fully managed database-as-a-service that makes it easy to deploy a clustered database.

Capella allows you to securely deploy, manage, and monitor database clusters through a single user interface.

NOTE: The fastest, easiest, and most affordable way to get started is to trial Capella with the _Couchbase’s Cloud Account_ option.
If you choose to trial Capella managed in _Your Cloud Provider_, please see xref:cloud:get-started:deploy-first-cluster.adoc[here] for additional prerequisites and set-up steps.

This is the first tutorial in the series of "First Timer" tutorials. 
It guides you through creating your first cluster and using it for storing and accessing data.

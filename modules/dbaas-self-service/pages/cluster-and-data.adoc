Having followed the sign up process and deployed your first cluster, follow the steps below to explore Couchbase Capella -- loading data, configuring your cluster, and connecting to it along the way.

* *Step 1*: <<#cluster>>
* *Step 2*: <<#metrics>>
* *Step 3*: <<#import>>
* *Step 4*: <<#configuration>>
* *Step 5*: <<#buckets>>
* *Step 6*: <<#connect>>

* *Step 8*: <<#sdk>>
* *Step 9*: <<#credentials>>

[#cluster]
=== Cluster

Click on the btn:[Projects] tab on the left.
This will show all the projects for your account. 
Projects are a great way to link clusters and users together for easier management. 
You can open a project by clicking on its name. 
With a project open, you will see a list of all clusters in the project, along with cluster health, cloud provider, and region information for each. 
 
Now click on btn:[Trial-Cluster].

[#metrics]
=== Metrics

You will now see multiple tabs below the cluster name. 
It will default to btn:[Metrics]. 
As this is your first time examining the cluster, no metrics are shown. 
So let’s add some.

You can add metrics one-by-one by clicking in the _Add Metrics_ area. 
The easier path is to use the template that is set up with several predefined metrics. 
Click the blue btn:[Data Services] link in the middle of the screen. 

This will add several metrics to your dashboard.

[#import]
=== Import Data

To start looking at some data, we first need to import a sample. 
Let’s do that now. 

. Click on the Tools tab and choose Import.
+
Here you will see three sample data sets and their descriptions.
 We will use the Travel Sample. 
If you want to get a detailed description of the data, data model, and other information about the data set, click on the btn:[Learn More] link. 

. Press the btn:[Import] button within the Travel Sample area.
This will start loading the data. 
It takes about a minute to load all the data.

[#configuration]
=== Configuration

Click on the Configuration tab.

The configuration tab shows settings like services, nodes, compute, and disk type. 
Following the free trial, and in a real account, you will be able to add & remove nodes and very easily make changes to hardware, memory, and storage.

This makes it easy to scale horizontally and vertically. 
Following configuration changes, Capella will automatically rebalance your data across nodes. 
No changes are needed on the application side. 
Also, services can be assigned per node, a feature we call Multi-Dimensional Scaling. 
For example, you may want compute-optimized hardware for one service and memory-optimized hardware for another.
This helps you performance match your application’s needs to the database and its infrastructure. 
By more efficiently using your hardware, you improve performance while also bringing down TCO.

[#buckets]
=== Buckets

Click on the btn:[Buckets] tab.

A bucket is a database within Couchbase. 
You can have more than one bucket. 
If you load all three datasets, then you will see them all here. 
You can see lots of information about each bucket.

We are going to make a change to the memory allocated to this bucket.

. Click on the name of the bucket. 
This will open a flyout with more details. 

. Click on the Memory tab and change the default of 200 to 1000. 
Then click btn:[Update]. 
This will make our queries faster later on.

[#connect]
=== Connect

Click on the Connect tab. 
This is where we will find information to establish an external connection to your Capella cluster.

Listed in the Wide Area Network area, you will see your database endpoint. 
The endpoint in the screenshot below has been changed, so your endpoint will look a little different.

[#allowed]
=== Allowed IP Addresses

Click on the btn:[Manage Allowed IP] link to enter your IP address. 
You must add your own IP address to connect to your cluster

. Click btn:[Add Allowed IP]
. For this exercise, choose the Add Permanent IP block. 
. Beside the IP Address/CIDR Block field, click btn:[Add My IP]
. The IP address your computer is currently using will be filled into the IP Address/CIDR Block field.
. Optionally add a descriptive comment, then click the btn:[Add IP] button.
Your IP address is saved as an _Allowed IP_ for connecting to your cluster.

[#sdk]
=== SDK Examples

Click on the btn:[SDK examples] link. 
This will open a flyout that provides details and sample connection code on the many SDKs for Capella.

[#credentials]
=== Database Credentials

In order to connect an external application to Capella, you must define at least one set of credentials. 
Click on the btn:[Manage Credentials] link. 
Then click the btn:[Create Database Credentials] on the right.

image::cluster-and-data/13.png[]


This will allow you to set up new credentials. 

. Enter a username and password. 

. Now choose your buckets, scopes, and access type. 
Choose _All Buckets_, _All Scopes_, and _Read/Write_. 
Press btn:[Create].

Congratulations. 
You finished this part of the tutorial. 
Now move on to the next section, xref:run-first-queries.adoc[run your first query].

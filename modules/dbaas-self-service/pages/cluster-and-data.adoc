Time to connect to your database.

== Essential Steps

Connecting to your Capella trial will allow you to access our pre-loaded "travel sample" dataset or to load your own data. 
xref:java-sdk:ref:travel-app-data-model.adoc[Click here] for more information on the travel sample data set.

* *Step 2*: <<#allowed>>
* *Step 3*: <<#sdk>>
* *Step 4*: <<#samples>>
* *Step 5*: <<#add-data>> 


[#credentials]
== Creating Database Credentials

In order to connect your IDE or external application to Capella, you must define at least one set of credentials. 

[NOTE] Credentials are different from Capella _users_. 
User roles are related to the organizing of UI access, projects, and things like billing.

.Step 1
. Click on Cluster section on the left side.
. Select your cluster name.
. Choose the *Connect* tab.
. Scroll to *Database Access* and click the btn:[Manage Credentials] link.

.Step 2
. Click the btn:[Create Database Credentials] on the right.
. Enter a username and password.
. Choose _All Buckets_, _All Scopes_, and _Read/Write_.
. Enter a username and password.

[#allowed]
== Allowed IP Addresses

You must add your own IP address to connect to your cluster.

.Step 1
. From the Database Credentials Screen, click on the btn:[Back] button.
. In the Connection section, select btn:[Manage Allowed IP].
. Click btn:[Add Allowed IP].

.Step 2
. For this exercise, choose the Add Permanent IP block. 
. Beside the IP Address/CIDR Block field, click btn:[Add My IP].
. The IP address your computer is currently using will be filled into the IP Address/CIDR Block field.
. Optionally add a descriptive comment, then click the btn:[Add IP] button.

Your IP address is saved as an _Allowed IP_ for connecting to your cluster.

[#sdk]
== Connecting to Capella Using SDKs

Couchbase services are exposed through the SDK. 
Whether you are writing key-value applications or querying via N1QL, Couchbaseâ€™s SQL language.

The Couchbase SDKs are available for developers to access clusters using their favorite IDE. 
Install appropriate Couchbase SDK. 
For more information on SDKs go to: xref:home:ROOT:sdk.adoc[]


[#samples]
== SDK Code Examples

Head back to the Capella UI and the Cluster section, Connect tab:

. Click on the btn:[SDK Examples] link. Opening a flyout.
. Check out the samples for: Java, C, Go, .NET, Node.js, PHP, and Python.
. Copy and paste into your IDE.
. Replace username and password with your new database credentials.
. For `bucketName`, replace the entry with "travel-sample".

From your IDE you should now be able to connect, create a JSON document, and run a Couchbase N1QL query. 

For more information Couchbase SDKs, see xref:home:ROOT:sdk.adoc[Docs] and the SDK section of our https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorials/#SDKs[Developer Tutorials], which include tutorials on building sample applications.

[#add-data]
== Add Your Data (Optional)

To load your own data into Capella, do the following.

. Within your Cluster section of the UI, click on the Tools tab.
. Choose Import.
. In the top area, select [Import] to walk through importing JSON or CSV data to your database.
. For more details on importing data, click xref:cloud:clusters:data-service/import-data-documents.adoc[here].

[NOTE]
====
If you load data into a new bucket that you have created, you will need to build an index before performing a N1QL query. 
(A primary index is simplest, but not recommended for production environments.)

Do this:

. Go to the Query Workbench (Within *Cluster, Tools*).
. Near Settings, leave "Select a bucket" as is. Make no change. 
. Execute `"CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON bucketName"` (replace with correct name).
 

Learn more about the Index Service in the xref:clusters:index-service/index-service.adoc[documentation].

Congratulations. 
You finished this part of the tutorial.

:description: Tutorial to install and operate Couchbase Server Community Edition (CE)

This tutorial will walk you through the steps to launch a single node server and manage some basic aspects.

This tutorial was built using the https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/introduction/editions.html[Community Edition(CE)] of Couchbase Server, so you can use this distribution to follow this guide free of charge. 

== Introduction to Couchbase Server Community Edition

https://www.couchbase.com/products/server[Couchbase Server] is an integrated document database and key-value store with a distributed architecture for performance, scalability, and availability. It enables developers to build applications easier and faster by leveraging the power of `SQL` with the flexibility of `JSON`.

== Installation

____
Tested for `Ubuntu 18.04`, `macOS Mojave` and `Windows 10`.
____

You can install the server in your machine (bare metal) or use a containerization tool such as `Docker`, to speed up this part of the tutorial.

=== Docker

This would be the fastest and easiest way to get the server started. If you need help installing `Docker`, their official documentation contains https://docs.docker.com/install/[installation guides] for multiple operating systems.

After `Docker` is up and running you can type this command on your terminal to launch the server.

[source,bash]
----
docker run -itd --name couchbase-server -p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210:11210 couchbase:community

== Initialization

The server starts automatically after installation but you can manage this behavior, as shown https://docs.couchbase.com/server/6.5/install/startup-shutdown.html[here].

If everything went well during installation, when you open up your browser on http://localhost:8091 you should see the Couchbase Server Web Console.

The next step will be to configure your server, so click on `Setup New Cluster`.

Choose a server name and an administrator with a password, these credentials must be saved for later use.

Now press `Finish With Defaults`, this should be enough to follow our tutorial. If you wish to better configure the server, up to your particular needs, follow this https://docs.couchbase.com/server/6.5/manage/manage-nodes/create-cluster.html#configure-couchbase-server[link].
